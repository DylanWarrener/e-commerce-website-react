# Clothing website prototype

This project has been created as a training exercise, following a 2022 react development training program on Udemy (by Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang). In this project, I have used React 17 that covers all of the modern toolchains that a React developer uses in 2022. I therefore present an e-commerce application similar to Shopify, using React, Redux, React Hooks, React Suspense, React Router, GraphQL, Context API, Firebase, Redux-Saga, Stripe + more. This is a full stack app (MERN stack), using Firebase.

The topics that have/will been/be utilised in this project are as follows:

- React Basics
- React Router
- Styled-Components
- Firebase
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- Asynchronous Redux
- Persistance + Session Storage
- React Hooks
- Context API
- React Suspense + React Lazy
- Stripe API
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- PWAs
- React Performance
- React Design Patterns
- Testing with Jest, Enzyme and Snapshot testing
